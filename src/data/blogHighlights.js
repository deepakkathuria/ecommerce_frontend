Layering jewellery is about balancing lengths, weights, and finishes. Start with two delicate chains of different lengths, add one statement pendant, and finish with a choker or collar. Keep metals consistent for a polished look or mix brushed and high-shine tones for contrast. Always leave at least two fingers’ width between pendants so they don’t clash.
