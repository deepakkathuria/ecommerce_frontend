Layering jewellery is about balancing lengths, weights, and finishes. Start with two delicate chains of different lengths, add one statement pendant, and finish with a choker or collar. Keep metals consistent for a polished look or mix brushed and high-shine tones for contrast. Always leave at least two fingers’ width between pendants so they don’t clash.

This season we worked with recycled brass bases dipped in thick 18k gold, finished with hand-set cubic zircons. The palette draws from late summer sunsets—amber, rose, and honey. Every piece is finished in Jaipur and polished in small batches to reduce waste.

Remove jewellery before showering, gym sessions, or swimming. Wipe pieces with a soft cloth after each wear and store them in zip pouches to prevent oxidation. For a deeper clean, use mild soap, lukewarm water, and a baby toothbrush—no harsh chemicals needed.
